Runs on a MySQL server hosted at localhost, on user 'root', with password 'pw12'.

Runs perfectly on Windows. Needs minor changes to work perfectly on Linux.

to run:

---

python launchqt.py

---



Dependencies:

---

pip install mysql.connector tabulate pyside6

---

You also need a MySQL server, obviously.

bonk.pdf contains contains TABLES and ERD GRAPHS, which are not language dependent.

It also contains instructions in Romanian.
